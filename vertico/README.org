This is the readme for this project.

** Description
An example of modern alternatives to completion and vertical navigation. Uses these packages:
- Vertico
- Orderless
- Consult
- Marginalia
- Embark

Start Emacs one time with the shell in the parent folder, so it can download and install software.
#+begin_example
../demo.{ps1|sh|cmd} vertico/init.el
#+end_example

This could work as a minimal example for an Emacs configuration with enabled tools for navigation and completion.
